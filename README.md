# Hear the Rhythm

### Team Name: Embedded Beats

### Team Members: Donald Hall, Matthew McTaggert, Matthew Mox

For our senior design class we created a digital stethoscope using the LPC54608Xpresso board. We took a regular analog stethoscope, cut the tube close to the diaphragm and inserted a lavaliere microphone into the tubing.  The microphone plugs into the board's audio input. Using Keil uVision we implemented a low-pass and band-pass filter to decrease noise and emphasize the desired sounds of a heartbeat signal. The LCD shows the heartbeat signal as well as the calculated heart rate. The report is included in the Github which gives a much more detailed explanation. A Demo can be seen at www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHKEfmI9dlM.
